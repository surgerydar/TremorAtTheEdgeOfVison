<p>Tremor at the Edge of Vision: a site-specific walking exploration of The Peregrine</p>
<p>
    J A Bakerâ€™s The Peregrine is a masterpiece of nature writing and the starting point for this on-site immersive experience created by experimental theatre maker, Jack McNamara.
</p>
<p>
    Fusing promenade, audio and 360 degree film, Tremor at the Edge of Vision explores the act of watching and waiting that Baker describes so viscerally in the book, through fragments of its diary-like text and glimpses of the ghosts left in its wake. It invites audiences to make a meditative journey through seven sites within Gunners Park in Shoeburyness, and the surrounding landscape to experience an immersive audio-visual experience inspired by the book and its enigmatic author.
